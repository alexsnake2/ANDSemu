ANDSemu 
=====

### Introduction

ANDSemu is a NDS emulator for Android based on nds4droid and DeSmuME. ANDSemu lets you play nintendo DS games on your phone or tablet with a streamlined GUI.

### License

ANDSemu is licensed under the GPLv3. Both nds4droid and DeSmuME has GPLv2 but we
include math-neon which is GPLv3.

Under the GPL you may redistribute, fork, or merge ANDSemu with your own application provided
you adhere to the terms of the license. This means you may create a fork of
ANDSemu and sell it in the Google Play App Store provided you provid all source
files and scripts used to build the apk.  

We love open source and if you comply with the GPL then we welcome your
competition.

### Installing ANDSemu

The recomended way to install ANDSemu is from the Google Play App Store.

An alternative method would be to build from source.

### Getting NDS games

We do not know how to get NDS games or roms, please do not ask us.

### Building ANDSemu from source

ANDSemu depends on ActionBarSherlock and the Android Support Libraries. You must
also run ndk-build to compile the DeSmuME and other native libraries.

We cannot provide help with compiling or setting up your development
environment.
